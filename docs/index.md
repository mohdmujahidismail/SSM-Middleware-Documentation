## Welcome to SSM Middleware

# Introduction
<br>
The latest SSM Middleware System is an enterprise application integration system that allows data to flow between SSM's main databases, multiple subsystems inside SSM, and external agencies. It creates a common platform for software application communication by establishing standard and structured services that may be consumed by possible service requestors whose systems are built on a variety of platforms and written in a variety of programming languages. Subscribers to SSM Middleware services will be able to get corporate and business information from SSM. 
<br><br>
SSM Middleware System includes a Middleware gateway for managing agency profiles, service catalogues, service subscriptions, price configuration, home publishing and subscriptions, and reporting. It is intended for internal usage by SSM in managing services and subscribers. The usage of a Java Enterprise platform enabled this extraordinary achievement.
